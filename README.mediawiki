== FunTechHouse_Door ==

Door controll system.
Keys used is iButton.

When door is opended or someone tried to open the door, this is sent to a mqtt server.

Time is stored in the RTC DS1307 and for timesync I use 
QuickDate (https://github.com/jsiei97/QuickDate) on a local webserver.

Please note that to build this project you need a filesystem on your PC that supports symbolic links, 
more or less you need a Linux based OS.
